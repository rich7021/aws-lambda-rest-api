# IAM

IAM user also can log into console or access service. The different between IAM user and root account is IAM users are access restricted. IAM controls what they can access and significantly reduces the exposure probability of root account. That makes your account more safety. Even if the IAM user is hacked, the consequences are more controllable. Think about once root account is hacked, the disaster will be unstoppable.
