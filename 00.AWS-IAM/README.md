# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

As the name, IAM is a service to manage identities and accesses in your account or services.

Signing in with IAM user can reduce times of log in with root account, it also reduce chances the root account is hacked (because of less times to transfer account information). It's a huge disaster when root account is hacked due to root account has fully control power, and it's unstoppable. <!--
